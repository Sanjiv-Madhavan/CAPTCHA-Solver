# CAPTCHA-Solver

## Description
<p>
This is a Text-based CAPTCHA solver designed using CNN and LSTM. This application attempts to solve three types of text-based CAPTCHAs namely Rotated, Noisy arc and Complicated Background. Each type of CAPTCHA is subjected to an appropriate pre-processing technique before being fed to the CNN and LSTM. Datasets for Rotated and Complicated background CAPTCHAs were manually created by choosing CAPTCHAs from various websites. The project was built using Python 3.5 .
